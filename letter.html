    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>

    Dear Eileen, <br>

    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part
        of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

    <h2>Starting dates</h2>

    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you
        could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>


    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>

    <p>You can find more information about <a href="#">important university dates</a> on our website.</p>


    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>

    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall
        somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just
        the
        kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by
        are
        as follows, in order of priority: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the
            audience
            size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)</li>
        <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>

    <p> So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the
        research
        to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>


    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>

    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,
        my
        favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>

    Polynesian chicken dance <br>
    <span class="indent_text">A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village
        would dance around</span> <br>
    <span class="indent_text">in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</span> <br>
    Icelandic brownian shuffle <br>
    <span class="indent_text">Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice
        this dance, which</span> <br>
    <span class="indent_text">involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies
        around in imperceptibly</span> <br>
    <span class="indent_text">tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this
        dance inspired
    </span> <br>
    <span class="indent_text">modern styles such as Twerking.</span> <br>
    Arctic robot dance <br>
    <span class="indent_text">An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed
        to have</span> <br>
    <span class="indent_text">discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being
        practiced by inhabitants</span> <br>
    <span class="indent_text">of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just
        moving like this</span> <br>
    <span class="indent_text">because they were really cold.</span> <br>
    <p>For more of my research, see <a href="#">my exotic dance research page.</a></p>
